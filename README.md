###
RPM is the package manager for the next generation of ILE. Be it RPG, C, C++, COBOL.. RPM is the tool for building your project. RPM can scale to mass sizes to suit large or small projects. Discover new tools and technology that you'd be able to use on your system for free. You can even use Relic as a build or DAB (deliver-and-build) tool for in-house software and shipping to your customers.

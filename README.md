### What is Relic? (RPM)
Relic Package Manager is a build tool that builds public and private ILE packages on your IBM i system. This allows developers to make their tools open-source and let Relic build them on other peoples systems. Relic is a community run project and hopefully ideas for Relic come out of the IBM i community. Relic makes use of current technologies such as DB2 services to access the internet.

In short it allows you to download the source of a package and execute the build script to end up with a final product. This in turn allows developers to host open source projects on GitHub or BitBucket for easy distribution.
